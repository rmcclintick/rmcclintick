### Hi there

I'm Robert - a fresh IT graduate with a focus on programming. I enjoy learning about and creating generative art, audio tools, networking, and games. I was a computer science major until 2016 when I had to drop out for financial reasons. I worked manual labor for several years before returning for my IT degree. 

### I'm currently learning
- PyTorch image recognition
- Java game development in LibGDX
